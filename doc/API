This is a start for some API documentation.  Using the parser and
'input.c' as a guide, this walks through the functions that can be
used to build an MLN and perform inference with it.


Making a samp_table_t object is required before anything else.  Within
this struct we can get the variable, sort, and other tables that we
will need.  Use 'init_samp_table' to set up the structure.  For
example:

samp_table_t samp_table;
init_samp_table(&samp_table);

will instantiate a samp_table_t object called 'samp_table'.



Declaring Sorts:

void add_sort(sort_table_t *sort_table, char *name):

     Adds the named sort 'name' to the specified sort_table.



void add_subsort(sort_table_t *sort_table, char *subsort, char *supersort):

     Adds the named subsort, to the sort_table, with the designaed supersort.




Declaring constants:

int32_t add_constant(char *cnst, char *sort, samp_table_t *table);

    Declares the name in 'cnst' as a constant of type 'sort', and
    enters this into 'table'.  Only one constant is declared at a
    time.



int32_t add_var(var_table_t *var_table,	char *name, sort_table_t *sort_table, char * sort_name);

    Declares the name in 'name' as a variable of type 'sort_name'.
    The variable name is entered into 'var_type' using the index of
    'sort_name' found in 'sort_table'.  Not documented as a command.


int32_t add_atom(samp_table_t *table, input_atom_t *current_atom);

    Adds an atom, but documentation suggests that this is not needed.



WARNING:  
int32_t assert_atom(samp_table_t *table, input_atom_t *current_atom, char *source);

    Adds 'current_atom' to the sample table.  How is 'current_atom'
    constructed?  The yacc parser assembles it by calling yy_atom on
    various alternative inputs:

input_atom_t *make_atom (char *pred, char **args, int32_t builtinop);

    where 'pred' is a predicate name, and 'args' is the predicate arg
    list.  An input_atom_t is simply a tuple whose slots are the
    predicate name and the arg list.  Not sure what 'builtinop' is
    about.  This suggests that we'll need a make_atom() function.


void add_cnf(char **frozen, input_formula_t *formula, double weight, char *source, bool add_weights);

    frozen: names delimited by curly braces { }.  Not used by mcsat.
    weight is the formula weight.
    add_weights is usually true.

    formula: variable names delimited by square braces [ ], followed
    by a logical formula over those variables.  Constructed by these
    functions:

    input_atom_t *make_atom (char *pred, char **args, int32_t builtinop);
    input_fmla_t *atom_to_fmla (input_atom_t *atom);
    input_fmla_t *make_fmla (int32_t op, input_fmla_t *arg1, input_fmla_t *arg2);
    input_formula_t *make_formula (char **vars, input_fmla_t *fmla);


=== NOTE: This describes the results of the 'add_clause' command.  I
=== have never seen this used, so perhaps it's not critical for most
=== applications.  It would be good to understand this better though.
=== The add_clause_xxx functions are declared 'static' within input.c

add_new_clause(samp_table_t *table, input_literal_t **clause, double weight,
	       char *source, bool add_weights);

    In "case ADD_CLAUSE" of 'read_eval', the static functions
    add_clause and add_clause_instance are used to add a new clause
    (with or without variables, respectively).  It might be best to
    define an external function that provides a wrapper for both of
    these, (e.g., add_new_clause above).  Here are the two signatures:

With vars:
static int32_t add_clause(input_clause_t *rule, double weight, char *source,
		samp_table_t *samp_table);

without:
static int32_t add_clause_instance(samp_table_t *table, input_literal_t **in_clause,
		double weight, char *source, bool add_weights);	




void add_cnf(input_formula_t *formula);

     Used by the 'add' command to add the given formula. 
     The formula argument can be constructed by make_formula.



void add_cnf_query(input_formula_t *formula);

     Used by the 'ask' command to set up a query based on the given formula. 
     The formula argument can be constructed by yy_formula.




extern void add_weighted_formula(samp_table_t* table, input_add_fdecl_t* decl);

     Used by the 'learn' command.  Adds a formula 'decl' to the table.
     Weight is included in the input_add_fdecl_t struct.  Not clear if
     we have to decompose this for a usable embedded API.



void mc_sat(samp_table_t *table,
     	    bool lazy,
	    uint32_t max_samples,
	    double sa_probability,
	    double sa_temperature,
	    double rvar_probability,
	    uint32_t max_flips,
	    uint32_t max_extra_flips,
	    uint32_t timeout,
	    uint32_t burn_in_steps,
	    uint32_t samp_interval);

    The Big Kahuna.  Performs inference on the table / network.  Aside
    from 'table', other args are parameters that affect the sampling
    algorithm.


void retract_source(char *source, samp_table_t *table);

     I think this is supposed to retract things that were added.


extern void dumptable(int32_t tbl, samp_table_t *table);

     Dispatcher to print out results of mcsat - this function uses
     several "dump_" functions that print specific kinds of
     information.
