Source File Descriptions
------------------------

1) Core source files

tables.c			Data structure containing all the information of a Markov logic
mcsat.c				Main entry
mcmc.c				Implements MC-SAT, which calls SampleSAT and WalkSAT
samplesat.c			Implements SampleSAT, which calls WalkSAT
walksat.c			Implements WalkSAT and MaxWalkSAT, including the management
					of atom assignments
ground.c			Generates ground instances from quantified CNF formulas,
					eagerly or lazily
cnf.c				Converts a recursively defined input formula to a CNF formula
input.c				Handles PCE commands, converts input data structures to
					internal data structures
parser.c

2) Utility data structures and algorithms

symbol_table.c
clause_list.c		Data structure of a singly linked list of clauses, which is used
					for organizing satisfied, watched, and unsatisfied clauses in
					WalkSAT
buffer.c			Buffers of PCE data structures to avoid repeated allocation and 
					free of temperary variables
array_hash_map.c	Hash map with arrays of integers as keys and integers as values
hash_map.c			Hash map with integers as keys and integers as values, used for 
					managing the unsatisfied auxiliary atoms for rules
hash_functions.c
int_array_sort.c
vectors.c
integer_stack.c		An integer stack, used for selecting a literal from an unsatisfied
					clause in WalkSAT
int_stack.c			How is it difference from integer_stack.c?
string_heap.c
memalloc.c			Safe memory allocation and free
memsize.c
gcd.c				Computes gcd of two integers
utils.c				Other utility functions


3) External libraries
