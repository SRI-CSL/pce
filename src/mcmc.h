 * Top-level MCSAT call
 *
 * Parameters for sample sat:
 * - sa_probability = probability of a simulated annealing step
 * - sa_temperature = temperature for simulated annealing
 * - rvar_probability = probability used by a Walksat step:
 *   a Walksat step selects an unsat clause and flips one of its variables
 *   - with probability rvar_probability, that variable is chosen randomly
 *   - with probability 1(-rvar_probability), that variable is the one that
 *     results in minimal increase of the number of unsat clauses.
 * - max_flips = bound on the number of sample_sat steps
 * - max_extra_flips = number of additional (simulated annealing) steps to perform
 *   after a satisfying assignment is found
 *
 * Parameters for mc_sat:
 * - max_samples = number of samples generated
 * - timeout = maximum running time for MCSAT
 * - burn_in_steps = number of burn-in steps
 * - samp_interval = sampling interval
