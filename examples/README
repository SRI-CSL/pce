PCE Example Programs
--------------------


1) Simple test cases

boys.pce			Boys born on Tuesday: An acquaintance tells you she has two
					children, one is a boy born on tuesday. What is the
					probability she has two boys?

cancer.pce			Marginal probability of a person being smoking in a social
					network.
cancer3.pce			MAP inference for the same model of cancer.pce
cancer4.pce			Example that illustrates a problem in lazy MC-SAT:
					samples tend to stay on the lowest cost assignment, causing
					the lowest cost assignment occupying more probability than
					it should be.


2) Test cases from alchemy tutorials

The original datasets of alchemy are available at 
http://alchemy.cs.washington.edu/alchemy1.html

Each of these test cases is in a separate folder. Take webkb as an example,
text-class.mln defines the MLN formulas, in which weights are unspecified and
to be learned; text-class-train.db is the training data; text-class-test.db is
the test data. We first use weight learning of alchmey, and text-class.mln and
text-class-train.db as input, to get text-class-out.mln which includes the
formulas with learned weights. Then we combine text-class-out.mln and
text-class-test.db, and convert to PCE format (because in PCE, the Markov logic
definition and the data are put in a single file), to get text-class.pce.
